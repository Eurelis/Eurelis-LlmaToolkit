# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# Global owners will be requested for review when someone 
# opens a pull request.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies Python files, only Python owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
